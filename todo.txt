we have to create a new booking caledar for the filament-booking plugin (similar to the schedule calendar), 
we also have to create new database tables for the booking caledar - booking_locations, booking schedule.
the booking_schedule table is for setting a specified location for each day to show in the bookings caledar
we display location in the first row 'allDayText: "location"' above before of the booking caledar time slots.
the booking calendar must show display create booking modal and save bookings in the booking_bookings table.
in the booking_bookings table we have to change shipping_price and shipping_method to start_time and end_time -
we also have to add service_date, service_note, is_active, notified_at, confirmed_at, completed_at columns -
and set swedish kronor as default currency and sweden as default country in the booking model and create modal.

the idea and usecase for this is that we have agents users working in callcenter booking service jobs in sweden
and the users with role=service are the service technicians performing the service jobs that the agents booked
so its important to keep track of who what agent made the booking and for what location and service technicians
and its alos important that new client is created when an agent makes a new booking in the booking calendar
